   <h2> Futuristic Visions </h2>
   <h1> Jeff is attending Galvanize in the hopes of a fulfilling career change </h1>
   <h1> Asked about what he sees in his future he paused, looked off into space, then slowly responded. </h1>
   <h1> "I've decided to change career paths and go to a programming school called Galvanize.  I'm eager to start down this road, because I really enjoy the ability to think both critically and creatively. Not many fields provide that, but programming does and that really excites me. I also see myself pursuing music and improving my skills as a naturalist. " </h1>
