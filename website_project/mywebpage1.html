   <h2> Unofficial site for Jeff Medders </h2>
   <p> Jeffrey grew up in Oklahoma, and graduated from the University of Oklahoma where he studied Ecology and graduated with a B.S. in 2013. He also obtained a minor in Russian Language and plans to backpack across Russia someday. </p>
   <p>Having grown tired of the flatlands he decided to move west. Jeff moved to Boulder, CO in early 2014 after living in California for a short time. </p>
   <p> In his free time he likes to hike, camp, go to concerts, and play music. He loves plants, bugs, and animals of all kind and is pictured to the right with a ladybug friend. </p>
   <p> In the fall of 2015 Jeff and friend, Tim Novak, formed a shoegaze/noise-pop/ambient band called Adult Colour. The duo plans to get in the recording studio in 2016 and play a small number of shows at houses, bars, or anywhere else that will have them.</p>
